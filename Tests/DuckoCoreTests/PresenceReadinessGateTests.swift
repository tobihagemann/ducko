/// Proves the PEP-reacting services suspend on `XMPPClient.awaitInitialPresenceSent()` before doing PEP work.
/// `BookmarksService` is the representative gate consumer — its `.connected` path issues a single bookmarks2
/// PEP retrieve — and the gate call is identical in `OMEMOService` and `AvatarService`. Without the gate, the
/// service would issue its retrieve immediately on `.connected` (before caps), which this test catches by
/// holding the caps-bearing presence off the wire.
