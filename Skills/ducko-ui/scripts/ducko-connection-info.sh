# Best-effort: selecting the account row drives a SwiftUI `List(selection:)`,
# which synthetic clicks cannot reliably trigger. The Actions pull-down holding
# "Connection Info…" only appears once the account is connected. It is located
# via findByAttr rather than `entire contents`, which collapses on macOS 26.
# Usage: ducko-connection-info.sh [open|close]
# Closing requires DUCKO_PID to target the intended instance.
