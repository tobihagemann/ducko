# Enumerate, select, cycle, or close the bottom conversation tabs in the chat window.
# Usage: ducko-chat-tabs.sh <list|select|close|next|previous|close-all> [JID]
#   list:        print the identity of all open tabs (one per line)
#   select JID:  click the tab for JID to make it active
#   close JID:   click the tab's close button (revealed on hover over the tab)
#   next:        Window > Select Next Tab (⌃⇥), wrapping at the end
#   previous:    Window > Select Previous Tab (⌃⇧⇥), wrapping at the start
#   close-all:   File > Close All Chats (⌥⌘W), closing every tab and the chat window
#
# Tab identity is the bare JID when unique. When the same peer JID is open under
# more than one account, each tab is account-qualified as "{jid}|{account-jid}"
# so the two are individually addressable. `list` prints whatever form is in use;
# pass that exact string to `select`/`close`.
#
# The tab bar is an accessibility container (`.accessibilityElement(children:
# .contain)`), so each `chat-tab-{jid}` chip is exposed as its own element —
# `list` and `select` resolve it under osascript. `close` is
# best-effort: its `chat-tab-close-{jid}` button is revealed only on hover and is
# merged into the chip's own combined element, so the identifier may not resolve.
# The integration suite (UIContactInfoTests) drives this control via Swift
# AXUIElement and is authoritative.
