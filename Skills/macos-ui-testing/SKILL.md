# macOS UI Testing (Background-Safe)

Run the `/peekaboo` skill first to load full Peekaboo CLI reference. This skill adds background-safe patterns on top.

## Background Safety Rules

Simulated keystrokes (`peekaboo type`, `peekaboo paste`, `peekaboo hotkey`) go to the **frontmost app**, not the target app. Always use background-safe alternatives.

| Action | Background-Safe | Command |
|---|---|---|
| Read UI tree | Yes | `peekaboo see --app APP --json` |
| Screenshot | Yes | `peekaboo see --window-id WID --no-elements` |
| Click element | Yes | `peekaboo click --no-auto-focus --on ELEM --app APP` |
| Set text value | Yes* | `osascript` with `set value of` |
| Read text value | Yes | `osascript` with `get value of` |
| Click button | Yes | `osascript` with `click button` |
| Type keystrokes | **NO** | Lands in frontmost app |
| Paste (Cmd+V) | **NO** | Lands in frontmost app |
| Hotkeys | **NO** | Lands in frontmost app |

*`set value` updates the accessibility layer but **does not trigger SwiftUI `@State` bindings**. Use `keystroke` inside a single osascript block when SwiftUI binding updates are needed (see Multi-Step Interaction Sequences below).

Prefer the `/lume-vm` VM for steps that move the pointer, bring windows to the front or switch the system appearance: the procedures below run there through `vm.sh gui` against a pushed app bundle. On the user's Mac, tell the user before any such step.

## Check for a Locked Screen

While the session screen is locked, window accessibility elements report the role `AXApplication`, controls inside windows can't be resolved, and window captures fail (`screencapture -l` reports "could not create image from window"). Read the lock state before starting the workflow:

```bash
ioreg -n Root -d1 -a | grep -A1 CGSSessionScreenIsLocked
```

`<true/>` on the line after the key means locked. No output means unlocked, because the key is absent then. An `ioreg` error, such as "can't open file" inside a sandbox, leaves the lock state unknown. When the screen is locked, record the GUI check as inconclusive instead of working around it.

## A Glitch in an App's First Frames

In the observed launch, the first accessibility answer came about half a second after the process started, so a layout glitch in an app's first frames is over before the first read. A screen recording is no substitute (see Step 4). Log the geometry from inside the app instead: put a logging probe into a scratch copy of the code and launch that. To check a fix, put the same probe into scratch copies of the unfixed and the fixed code and compare the logs.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Launch the App

```bash
# For SwiftPM-built apps:
swift run AppName &>/dev/null &
APP_PID=$!
sleep 3

# For installed apps:
open -a "AppName"
```

### Step 2: Verify the App Is Running

```bash
peekaboo app list | grep -i AppName
```

### Step 3: Read the UI Tree

```bash
peekaboo see --app AppName --json
```

Parse the JSON output to find element IDs (`elem_N`), roles, and labels.

### Step 4: Take a Screenshot

Resolve the window ID first, then capture by ID:

```bash
peekaboo window list --app AppName
peekaboo see --window-id WID --no-elements --path /tmp/screenshot.png
```

Capture by window ID only. A screen recording, or a capture of the whole screen or a region of it, holds everything else the user has open, and shows whatever is in front, which may not be the app. `screencapture -l WID` has captured a window correctly while it was on another Space.

In top-level code of a Swift script that captures with ScreenCaptureKit, annotate the result (`let image: CGImage = try await SCScreenshotManager.captureImage(...)`), or the completion-handler overload is chosen and the result is `Void`. Touch `NSApplication.shared` before the first capture, or it asserts in `CGS_REQUIRE_INIT`.

To cut a region out of a capture, read it with `CGImageSource`, crop it with `CGImage.cropping(to:)` and write it with `CGImageDestination`. The rectangle is in pixels, and one that runs past the image is clamped without an error, so check the result's size. `sips -c H W --cropOffset 0 0` crops the center rather than the top left, and sips cannot write its temporary file inside the Bash sandbox.

### Step 5: Interact with Elements

**Click an element** (accessibility API, no focus needed):

```bash
peekaboo click --no-auto-focus --on elem_4 --app AppName
```

**Set a text field value** (background-safe, but does NOT trigger SwiftUI bindings):

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to set value of text field 1 of group 1 of window 1 of process "AppName" to "text"'
```

**Read a text field value**:

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to get value of text field 1 of group 1 of window 1 of process "AppName"'
```

**Click a button by name**:

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "System Events" to click button "Submit" of group 1 of window 1 of process "AppName"'
```

> **Synthetic coordinate clicks don't drive SwiftUI gestures.** AppleScript `click at {x,y}` and `peekaboo click --at X,Y` do **not** trigger `.onTapGesture`/`.simultaneousGesture` or `List(selection:)` selection — only real user clicks or an accessibility **`AXPress`** on an actual `Button` do (`peekaboo click --on ELEM` from `see --json`). So a `Button` is verifiable, but UI relying on tap gestures or list selection **can't be confirmed by synthetic clicks** — treat such a result as a signal, not proof, and hand the app to the user when only real clicks suffice.
>
> Peekaboo targets apps by **display name** (`--app Ducko`), not the executable name (`DuckoApp`).
>
> Peekaboo 4 replaced `click --coords` with `--at X,Y`. In the background, `--at` coordinates are relative to the window of a `--snapshot` from a fresh `see --window-id WID`. `--foreground` focuses the target app instead, so use it only in the `/lume-vm` VM.

### Step 6: Verify Results

Take another screenshot or read values back to confirm the interaction succeeded.

### Step 7: Stop the App

```bash
kill $APP_PID
```

## Multi-Step Interaction Sequences

Each tool call returns focus to the terminal. Multi-step flows **must** be in a single `osascript` heredoc -- splitting across tool calls loses focus between steps.

```bash
osascript << 'APPLESCRIPT'
tell application "System Events"
    set frontmost of process "AppName" to true
    delay 0.5
    tell process "AppName"
        click text field 1 of group 1 of window 1
        delay 0.3
        keystroke "username"
        delay 0.2
        keystroke tab
        delay 0.2
        keystroke "password"
        delay 0.3
        click button 1 of group 1 of window 1
    end tell
end tell
APPLESCRIPT
```

This pattern uses `keystroke` (triggers SwiftUI bindings) and keeps focus on the target app throughout the sequence.

**Important**: Use `osascript << 'APPLESCRIPT'` heredoc syntax (not `osascript -e`) to avoid shell escaping issues.

## osascript Element Discovery

When the UI hierarchy is unknown, explore it incrementally with osascript. See [references/osascript-patterns.md](references/osascript-patterns.md) for element addressing patterns and exploration techniques.

## Peekaboo Focus Timeout Issue

Peekaboo's `click` and `type` with `--app` try to activate the app first. For SwiftPM-built apps this often times out because `NSRunningApplication.activate()` is not acknowledged.

**Workarounds:**
- Use `--no-auto-focus` on `click` commands
- `see` works fine with `--app` or `--window-id` (read-only, skips focus)

**Caveat with `--no-auto-focus`**: Clicks use absolute screen coordinates. If another window overlaps the target, the click hits the wrong window. Prefer `osascript` click (accessibility API, position-independent) for reliable button clicks.

## Driving SwiftUI Controls (gotchas)

SwiftUI controls bridge to accessibility in ways that defeat naive synthetic automation:

- **Auto-focusing fields need confirmed focus and targeted input.** Activate the intended app and, for an identifiable field, confirm that its application’s `kAXFocusedUIElementAttribute` resolves to that field before typing. Ducko’s integration harness posts Unicode CGEvents to the owned PID with `postToPid`. System Events keystrokes and global event taps depend on the frontmost app, so avoid them when multiple instances are open. If a field does not expose its typed text through `kAXValue`, assert the resulting behavior, such as filtered rows.
- **A SwiftUI `Menu` (`.menuStyle(.button)`) exposes its opened menu in one of two places**: as a `kAXMenuRole` descendant of the button, or as a top-level `AXMenu` among the application's children, a sibling of the windows like a context menu. Both have been observed, and `kAXShownMenuUIElementAttribute` on the button returned neither. Search the button's descendants first, then the app's top children excluding the menu bar. To open it, use an `AXPress` (`kAXPressAction`), not a coordinate click (see the Step 5 note). The Menu's label text isn't in `kAXValue` — add `.accessibilityValue(...)` in the app so the current selection is readable (also a VoiceOver win).
- **A menu opened only to read its items stays open on screen.** Pressing an item closes a menu; `AXCancel` (`kAXCancelAction`) on it leaves it up. While it is up, another `AXShowMenu` opens nothing, so a lookup of the open menu returns the earlier one and every reading after the first is stale. Close a menu that was only read by activating the app and posting Escape to that process alone (`CGEvent.postToPid`, virtual key 53). Confirm it closed from the process's on-screen windows: in `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` filtered by owner PID, an open menu is a window at the pop-up-menu level (layer 101).
- **osascript `entire contents` silently truncates on deep SwiftUI AX trees** — it misses deeply-nested identifiers that `peekaboo see --json` and a Swift `AXUIElement` walk find reliably; `... of window 1` (e.g. `UI element of window 1`) only checks **direct** children, not descendants. Don't rely on osascript element-finding for deeply-nested SwiftUI elements — use peekaboo or a Swift AX walk. Menu-bar navigation (`click menu item "X" of menu 1 of menu bar item "Y" of menu bar 1`) stays reliable and is the robust way to drive menu commands from osascript.
- **A context menu opened in an AppKit `NSTableView` that hosts SwiftUI rows can hang off the table.** On macOS 27, `AXShowMenu` on a row's static text opened a menu that appeared as an `AXMenu` under the `AXTable`, not among the application's top children and not under the text. When the search of the application's top children finds nothing, search the windows for a `kAXMenuRole` element.
- **A `Button` at `.opacity(0)` was not found in the accessibility tree by identifier**, and a control inserted only while hovering (`if isHovering { … }`) exists only while the pointer is over it. To reach such a control's effect without a pointer, give an always-present element a named action (`.accessibilityAction(named:)`). It shows up in that element's action names (`AXUIElementCopyActionNames`) as a multi-line string that starts with `Name:<title>` (observed: `Name:Copy Code\nTarget:0x0\nSelector:(null)`); pass that exact string to `AXUIElementPerformAction`.
- **Key presses with modifiers can be posted to one process.** Set `flags` on the `CGEvent` (`.maskShift`, `.maskAlternate`) before `postToPid`; SwiftUI `.onKeyPress` handlers receive the modifiers. Virtual key 36 is Return, and 76 is the keypad's Enter (posted with `.maskNumericPad`). In the observed run the app had been activated with `NSRunningApplication.activate()`, yet `NSApp.keyWindow` was nil while keys were posted this way, and `NSApp.sendAction(_:to:from:)` with a nil target returned false. Confirm a key window before relying on a responder-chain action.
- **`AXScrollToVisible` scrolled an element of a `LazyVStack` into view** when performed on an element already in the tree. Confirm with a window screenshot.
- **A tooltip appears only under a resting pointer, in a window of its own.** To verify one, record the pointer position, activate the app by PID, post `mouseMoved` events to the HID event tap at a few points ending on the target, and wait about 2.5 seconds. The tooltip is then a new on-screen window owned by that PID in `CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo` (observed at layer 103 on macOS 27). Capture that window by its ID (see Step 4). Then put the pointer back at the recorded position with `CGWarpMouseCursorPosition`. This moves the user's real pointer, so tell them first, and retry once when no tooltip appears. SwiftUI `.help` text also reads back as `kAXHelpAttribute` unless the view clears its accessibility hint, so a missing attribute does not mean a missing tooltip. Choose every point the pointer is moved to, including a spot a script parks it at between steps, away from the screen corners: a corner fires the hot corner set there (`defaults read com.apple.dock wvous-<tl|tr|bl|br>-corner`), which can put the display to sleep or open Mission Control mid-run. The recorded position the pointer returns to is the user's own and stays as it was.
- **A test that triggers a copy overwrites the user's clipboard.** Save every pasteboard item's types and data first (`NSPasteboard.general.pasteboardItems`) and read the result. Then call `clearContents()` and `writeObjects` with new `NSPasteboardItem`s built from the saved data.
