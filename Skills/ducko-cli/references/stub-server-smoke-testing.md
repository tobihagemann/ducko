# Stub-Server Smoke Testing

Exercise stream-level behavior (STARTTLS negotiation, stream features, injected or malformed server data) through the CLI against a local stub instead of a live server, or run a whole session against a stub that serves a made-up roster.

## Point the CLI at the Stub

Run a one-connection Python stub on a free `127.0.0.1` port. Check the port with `lsof -iTCP:<port> -sTCP:LISTEN` first, record the stub's PID for cleanup, and start a fresh stub per scenario. Binary, profile prefix and cleanup follow the Throwaway Profiles section of SKILL.md.

- **Pre-auth, creates no account**: `.build/debug/DuckoCLI account check-registration --server example.com --host 127.0.0.1 --port <port>`
- **Login path**: `DUCKO_PROFILE=<unique> .build/debug/DuckoCLI account add alice@example.com --password x --host 127.0.0.1 --port <port>`.

Failures exit 1 with `Error: <summary>[: <reason>]`. `account check-registration` reports a rejected stream header or features element only as `Error: Unexpected response from the server`.

## Stub Requirements

1. Read until `<stream:stream` arrives.
2. Reply with a stream header carrying `version='1.0'`, then a `<stream:features>` element. The client rejects a version other than 1.0, or a features element with a different name, before reaching the code under test.
   ```xml
   <?xml version='1.0'?><stream:stream xmlns='jabber:client' xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams' from='example.com' version='1.0' id='stub'><stream:features><starttls xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-tls'><required/></starttls></stream:features>
   ```
3. Read until the client's next element (e.g. `<starttls`) arrives before answering it, unless the scenario deliberately pipelines ahead of the client.
4. When the scenario depends on elements arriving together (e.g. `<proceed/>` plus injected data), send them in a single `sendall`.
5. Log every byte string sent and received, so a surprising result can be traced to what actually went over the wire.
6. Hold the socket open until the client closes it, with a socket timeout so the stub never lingers.

## Pair Negative Scenarios with a Control

A rejection only means something when a control that differs in the dimension under test reaches the code beyond it. For example, a stub that answers `<starttls/>` with `<proceed xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-tls'/>` plus an injected `<message>` in one send expects `Secure connection failed: The server sent unexpected data after agreeing to start TLS`. Its control sends only the `<proceed/>`, so the client starts a real TLS ClientHello. Answering that with non-TLS junk such as `HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\r\n\r\n` yields a handshake reason (e.g. `Secure connection failed: record overflow`), which proves the upgrade was reached.

## Probe a Real Server's Raw Replies

Use `openssl s_client` to see what a live server answers after STARTTLS. Pipe a post-TLS stream header plus the stanzas to send, and bound the run, since `s_client` otherwise holds the connection open:

```
(printf "<stream:stream xmlns='jabber:client' xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams' to='<domain>' version='1.0'><iq type='get' id='q1'><query xmlns='jabber:iq:register'/></iq>"; perl -e 'select(undef,undef,undef,5)') \
  | perl -e 'alarm 10; exec @ARGV' openssl s_client -connect <host>:5222 -starttls xmpp -xmpphost <domain> -quiet > "$TMPDIR/probe.txt" 2>&1
```

## Stub a Whole Session

To take the client past login to a connected session with a roster and contact presence, run [stub.py](../../demo-screenshots/scripts/stub.py):

```bash
python3 Skills/demo-screenshots/scripts/stub.py <port> <workdir>
```

`<workdir>` is an existing directory that receives `stub.log`. The stub plays the account `tobias@pond.example`, accepts repeated connections, and runs until killed, so record its PID for cleanup. For other server data, copy `Skills/demo-screenshots/content.json`, edit the copy, and pass its path as a third argument.

The stub speaks plaintext, so the account needs Require TLS off. The CLI has no option for it. Add the account, then set it in the throwaway profile's store. The second command must print `1`:

```bash
DUCKO_PROFILE=<unique> .build/debug/DuckoCLI account add tobias@pond.example --password x --host 127.0.0.1 --port <port> --no-connect
sqlite3 "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Ducko-Dev-<unique>/default.store" "UPDATE ZACCOUNTRECORD SET ZREQUIRETLS=0; SELECT changes();"
```

CLI commands on that profile then connect through the stub. A GUI instance on the same profile does so once its status is set to Available.

Beyond Stub Requirements 1 to 5, a stub written from scratch has to:

1. Offer only `PLAIN` in `<mechanisms>`, without `<starttls>`, and answer `<auth>` with `<success/>`.
2. Parse the restarted stream with a fresh XML parser and offer `<bind/>` in its features.
3. Answer the bind request with the full JID in `<bind><jid>`, and answer the roster request.
4. Send the contacts' `<presence>` after the client's first available presence.
5. Answer the client's other requests: a result for carbons enable, an empty `<blocklist/>`, `item-not-found` for PEP item requests, an empty result for PEP publishes, a `vCard` for `vcard-temp`, and `<fin xmlns='urn:xmpp:mam:2' complete='true'>` for an archive query. Answer any other IQ request with `service-unavailable`.
6. Echo each request's `to` as the reply's `from`, and omit `from` when the request has no `to`. The client drops a reply to an addressed request that comes from any other JID.
