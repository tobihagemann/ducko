/// One-shot live-server fixture hygiene suite. Skipped by default; runs only
/// when `DUCKO_RESET_FIXTURES=1` and the standard `IntegrationTests/.env.test`
/// credentials are configured.
///
/// Two server-side drift sources motivate this suite:
///
/// 1. PEP `urn:xmpp:omemo:2:devices` accumulates stale device IDs across
///    runs, and each obsolete device leaves a dangling
///    `urn:xmpp:omemo:2:bundles:<deviceID>` node behind. Once the list
///    crosses `OMEMOModule.pruneProbeCap` (64) the client cannot self-heal;
///    sends race ack overflow and dependent tests fail. Retracting the
///    devicelist and reconnecting causes `OMEMOModule.ensureOwnDeviceInList`
///    to publish a fresh singleton list containing only the live device ID.
///    Then a disco#items sweep deletes every other bundle node so the live
///    server matches the post-`purge-test-omemo.sql` shape (one devicelist
///    + one bundle per account).
///
/// 2. Roster baseline subscriptions can be lost (server retention edges,
///    per-test side effects). UI tests that expect Bob's contact row on
///    Alice fail silently. The reset reseeds `subscription=both` for the
///    canonical pairs (alice ↔ bob, alice ↔ carol) and persists the result
///    by NOT registering removal cleanups. Per `TestCredentials.swift`,
///    Dave must have NO baseline subscription with any other account
///    (`SubscriptionDance.assertNoSubscription` enforces this), so the
///    reset actively scrubs every dave-paired subscription (alice ↔ dave,
///    bob ↔ dave, carol ↔ dave) instead of seeding any of them.
